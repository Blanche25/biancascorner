            <p>hello! <br> ive been wanting to make a personal website for a while so here it is! took like a couple days and a LOT of searching for stuff and snippets and god but i think it came out pretty well! i am very new to makin websites and such even if i technically did do html and css at school (and php)((ew)). <br><br>
            so anyways for the aesthetic i tried to emulate (plagiarize?) another neocities page which i really liked, which is <a href="https://juneish.neocities.org/">june's room</a>, though technically i copied an older version of their page (PS if you want this taken down contact me!)
            <br><br>
            and yeah ive got a neocities page woohoo! still not sure what im gonna put on here, i want to make more music so maybe ill put it here. who knows! ive been kinda overwhelmed with all the stuff on the "indie web" as i think its called like webrings blinkies and other stuff from an age i never lived in. looks cool!
