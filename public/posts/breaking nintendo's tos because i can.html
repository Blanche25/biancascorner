            <p>
                ok so basically i've had a nintendo switch since basically its
                launch, but after the first 3ish years i just kinda stopped
                using it.
                <br><br>
                why did i decide to stop using 300+ euros worth of console?
                well, my non-existant reader, the reason is simple: joycon drift
                was driving me absolutely insane. it was terrible. i even tried
                buying a brand new set of joycons some time after, but can you
                guess what happened to those? can you guess??????? yeah they
                started to drift too, even faster than the first pair. <br />
                so here i am, 7 (i think?) years later, suddenly wanting to make
                it usable, since there's some games i'd like to play on it
                (persona 5 royal my beloved (yes i could just play it on pc i
                just think the switch is way more convenient))
                <br><br>
                so i started looking around for fixes for the joycons, and i'd
                heard that nintendo was offering free repairs for joycon drift.
                so. i sent it to them... and they asked for 60 euros, which is
                insane cuz that's literally the price of a new pair of joycons
                so i gave up on that.
                <br><br>
                until about a couple months later when i discovered that the
                issue just fixes itself by shoving a literal piece of cardboard
                inbetween the stick and the battery for some arcane reason?? but
                that's nice ig.
                <br><br>
                but then... i discovered... to play games... i have to... buy
                them... *dies* <br>
                which is why i decided to give modding my switch a try <br>
                ok piracy isn't the only reason, i also wanted to theme my homescreen
                since i saw some people do it and i thought it was really cool.
                <br> also i had already modded my 3ds some time before that so
                really how hard could it possibly be?
                <br><br>
                well to be fair i genuinely thought it was gonna be a lot
                harder but all in all it was pretty chill! most of the time
                it took was spent just waiting for files to transfer to my
                sd card.<br>
                also for anyone interested <a href="https://switch.hacks.guide/">this is the guide i used</a>,
                very easy to follow and explains all the steps well enough that
                even a dunce like me can do it.
                <br><br>
                so yeah! it works pretty well, it's a bit annoying having to make sure
                it never turns off completely (otherwise you have to re-inject the payload
                which ig is fine since you can do it by connecting your switch to your phone
                with rekado) and setting up things is a bit harder since there's
                a lot less documentations than what i'm used to with the 3ds, but in the end
                i think it was definitely worth it!
                <br><br>
                right now i'm playing p5r and sea of stars, another rpg which so far
                i think is pretty cool. i might make a section of the site just to talk
                about games/media in general... or maybe i'll just use the blog to talk
                about them. who knows!
