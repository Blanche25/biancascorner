        <hr>
        <small>5th jan 2025</small>
        <p>so! i've just finished reading House of Leaves by Mark Z. Danielewski
            and i wanted to say a couple things about it so here we go!
            <br><br><hr><br>
            <div style="text-align: justify;  text-justify: inter-word;">
                it's an incredibly confusing book, and intentionally so. in many
                parts it feels like its actively trying to make you stop reading
                and do literally anything else and i absolutely love it. even though my attention span 
                is ass it still managed to keep me interested the whole way through and
                i managed to finish it in like a week which is a lot less than i expected.
                <div style="float: left; max-width: 300px; max-height: fit-content; border: solid 1px blue; padding:2px; margin: 8px; margin-left: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">
                    &#x202e; also what's up with Johnny? the book never really tells you what's
                    really happening with him in any way whatsoever. i got to the end
                    still trying to figure out what the fuck i just read.
                    also why does he like to write about sex so much? like damn bro
                    chill jesus christ.
                </div>
                <div style=" transform: rotate(270deg); float: right; max-width: 250px; margin: 0; max-height: 250px;">
                    every time i was curious to see what inflated arguments it would pull
                    out of its ass to bore you to death. and sometimes it's not even worthless!
                    like it makes you think it is but then somehow it comes back? like without
                    spoiling too much there's a part in which it goes into an analysis of
                    the echo in every sense possible but then you find out it's a theme
                    that returns multiple times! 
                </div>
                pretty crazy book, though definitely not
                for everyone, i can see how some people would absolutely hate it.
                <div style="text-decoration-line: line-through; color: red;">
                i know absolutely nothing about the minotaur. 700 pages later and i've no idea what it is
                </div>
                i also didn't take any notes while reading, though sometimes i was tempted and i know
                many people did (can't blame them i mean if i were to try and analyze this i would
                have a stroke).
                definitely one of the weirdest books i've ever read. absolutely worth it though. i'm also
                kinda disappointed i don't have one of those editions with the cover slightly smaller
                than the book itself.
            </div>
            <br><hr><br>
            ...so yeah overall pretty good book, 8/8, might be one of my favorites.
