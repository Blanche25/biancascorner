            <p>
                ok so basically i've had a nintendo switch since basically its
                launch, but after the first 3ish years i just kinda stopped
                using it. <br />
                why did i decide to stop using 300+ euros worth of console?
                well, my non-existant reader, the reason is simple: joycon drift
                was driving me absolutely insane. it was terrible. i even tried
                buying a brand new set of joycons some time after, but can you
                guess what happened to those? can you guess??????? yeah they
                started to drift too, even faster than the first pair. <br />
                so here i am, 7 (i think?) years later, suddenly wanting to make
                it usable, since there's some games i'd like to play on it
                (persona 5 royal my beloved (yes i could just play it on pc i
                just think the switch is way more convenient))
                <br />
                so i started looking around for fixes for the joycons, and i'd
                heard that nintendo was offering free repairs for joycon drift.
                so. i sent it to them... and they asked for 60 euros, which is
                insane cuz that's literally the price of a new pair of joycons
                so i gave up on that.
                <br />
                until about a couple months later when i discovered that the
                issue just fixes itself by shoving a literal piece of cardboard
                inbetween the stick and the battery for some arcane reason?? but
                that's nice ig.
                <br />
                but then... i discovered... to play games... i have to... buy
                them... *dies* <br />
